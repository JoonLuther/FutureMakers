Reflections

7/6: I hope to learn more about the different tools I will be using throughout the program
7/7: David Kong's Leadership and Storytelling workshop reminded me of listening to the Moth Radio Hour podcast because I got to hear so many unique stories from my peers. I learned more about how other people have discovered their calling, and how I have discovered mine.
7/8: I learned that supervised learning is when the machine uses data for classification and regression and makes a prediction, and that unsupervised learning is when the machine uses data to identify patterns and form clusters of samples.
