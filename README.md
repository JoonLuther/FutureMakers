7/6: I hope to learn more about the different tools I will be using throughout the program

7/7: David Kong's Leadership and Storytelling workshop reminded me of listening to the Moth Radio Hour podcast because I got to hear so many unique stories from my peers. I learned more about how other people have discovered their calling, and how I have discovered mine.

7/8: I learned that supervised learning is when the machine uses data for classification and regression and makes a prediction, and that unsupervised learning is when the machine uses data to identify patterns and form clusters of samples.

7/12: Today I learned that tensors are like matricies that store data for machine learning. I also enjoyed reading the article and running the included code. I liked seeing how the different tensor opperations are performed using code.

7/15 - Day 10: I enjoyed playing the survival of the fittest game and observing how the AI mimicked the way I hired hypothetical candidates. The time crunch rushed my decisions which may have contributed to me selecting more "orange" candidates than "blue" candidates. As a result, the AI was biased toward the orange candidates and hired a disproportionate amount than the population. This game reflects real life hiring practices that can be biased toward certain genders and ethnicities.
