Reflections

7/6: I hope to learn more about the different tools I will be using throughout the program

7/7: David Kong's Leadership and Storytelling workshop reminded me of listening to the Moth Radio Hour podcast because I got to hear so many unique stories from my peers. I learned more about how other people have discovered their calling, and how I have discovered mine.

7/8: I learned that supervised learning is when the machine uses data for classification and regression and makes a prediction, and that unsupervised learning is when the machine uses data to identify patterns and form clusters of samples.

7/12: Today I learned that tensors are like matricies that store data for machine learning. I also enjoyed reading the article and running the included code. I liked seeing how the different tensor opperations are performed using code.
